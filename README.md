## Features
- Sync tracks from iPod to Last.fm profile.
- Preserve offline listening history digitally.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation.

## Known Issues
- Currently, songs played multiple times are scrobbled only once to Last.fm. This is due to the limitation of iPod Play Counts, which only save the timestamp for the first time the track has been listened to. Further investigation is required to address this issue.
- Once you've set the path to the iPod, you may need to restart the application.
